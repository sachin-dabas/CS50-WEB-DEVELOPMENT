      <strong>Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 and sometimes stylized as web3)
       is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain
      technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token
      -based economics.</strong> <em>Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it
       with Web 2.0, wherein they say data and content are centralized in a
       small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech".</em>The term
        "Web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the
        idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large
         technology companies, and venture capital firms.[6][7]
