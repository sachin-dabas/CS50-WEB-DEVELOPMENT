          Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 and sometimes stylized as web3) is an idea
          for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain
          technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and
          token-based economics.
        </strong>
        <em>
          Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0,
          wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of
          companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech".
         </em>
         The term"Web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the
          idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large
          technology companies, and venture capital firms.[6][7]
